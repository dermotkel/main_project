It is first important to find out the differences between a Sepal and a Petal. The Sepal is on the outside and the petal is on the inside, closr to the centre of the flower. The below sideview of an Irish shows the difference clearly.

A visual inspection of the flowers suggest that the setosa's petals are significantly smaller than the others.
